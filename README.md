## What is React JS ? why React Js?

ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to create user interfaces in a declarative and efficient way. It is a component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of a Model View Controller (MVC) architecture1. ReactJS is used to create modular user interfaces and promotes the development of reusable UI components that display dynamic data. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

##### Here are some reasons why developers choose to use ReactJS:

1. Flexibility: ReactJS is remarkably flexible. Once you have learned it, you can use it on a vast variety of platforms to build quality user interfaces.
2. Great Developer Experience: ReactJS provides a great developer experience, making it easier to debug and predict your code.
3. Performance: ReactJS has great performance. It creates a virtual DOM in memory to update the browser’s DOM.
4. Support/Resources: ReactJS has the support of Facebook and a broader community.
5. Easy to Test: ReactJS is easy to test3.
Reusable Components: ReactJS enables developers to create reusable components that can be used across different projects, making the development process more efficient.

ReactJS is used by many Fortune 500 companies and has a robust ecosystem5. It’s worth noting that ReactJS is not a framework, but a library developed by Facebook1. It’s used to solve some problems that developers were facing earlier1. Today, you can build whole applications for web browsers and smartphones using ReactJS5.

# Difference between package.json and package-lock.json

package.json: This file contains metadata about the project, including its name, version, description, entry point, scripts, and dependencies. It also lists the npm packages required for the project to run. Developers typically use this file to define project-specific configurations and dependencies. Here's a basic example of what a package.json file might look like for a React project:

```json
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A sample React application",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // Dev dependencies like testing libraries, build tools, etc.
  }
}

```
package-lock.json: This file is automatically generated by npm when you install or update packages in your project. It serves as a detailed record of the exact versions of dependencies that were installed. This ensures that your project has deterministic builds, meaning that every time someone installs dependencies for your project, they get the exact same versions that you have specified in your package.json file. It helps to prevent version conflicts and ensures consistency across different environments.
package-lock.json should not be modified manually. It's meant to be automatically updated by npm when you install or update packages using commands like npm install or npm update
